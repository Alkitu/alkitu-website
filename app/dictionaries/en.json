My contribution included executing two projects, with the standout being the creation of a website.\n\nThe initial concept for the website was designed in Figma by another team member. My task was to bring this design to life, selecting the most appropriate stack for the company's needs. Given the prevailing familiarity within the team with the MERN stack, I chose to develop the website using NextJS, aiming to improve its indexing on major browsers.\n\nIt is relevant to note that a few months after the project's completion, REACT announced its recommendation to choose one of the popular React-based frameworks in the community, among which NextJS is included. This fact validates the strategic choice made during the project development, reaffirming the quality and relevance of the selected technology.",

I used HTML5 and JavaScript to develop the game logic and manipulate objects on the canvas, complemented by CSS3 for the design and layout of the interface. GitHub served as the version control platform, while environment and character graphics were created using Adobe Illustrator. This project not only showcases my ability to combine front-end development with graphic design but also culminates in an interactive game that reflects my competence in integrating web technologies and design tools.\n\nI deeply appreciate Pedro Salazar for his support in the final stage. Together, in just 3 weeks, we fulfilled a childhood dream by creating this video game, while managing other work commitments. Effective task coordination and the ability to work as a team under pressure were crucial in meeting this challenge in such a short time, demonstrating our passion and commitment to the realization of innovative projects.",
