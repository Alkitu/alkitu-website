        "description": "After completing the bootcamp at \"Ironhack,\" I had the opportunity to do remote internships in English for 4 months at an innovative startup based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. My contribution included executing two projects, with the standout being the creation of a website.\n\nThe initial concept for the website was designed in Figma by another team member. My task was to bring this design to life, selecting the most appropriate stack for the company's needs. Given the prevailing familiarity within the team with the MERN stack, I chose to develop the website using NextJS, aiming to improve its indexing on major browsers.\n\nIt is relevant to note that a few months after the project's completion, REACT announced its recommendation to choose one of the popular React-based frameworks in the community, among which NextJS is included. This fact validates the strategic choice made during the project development, reaffirming the quality and relevance of the selected technology.",

I used HTML5 and JavaScript to develop the game logic and manipulate objects on the canvas, complemented by CSS3 for the design and layout of the interface. GitHub served as the version control platform, while environment and character graphics were created using Adobe Illustrator. This project not only showcases my ability to combine front-end development with graphic design but also culminates in an interactive game that reflects my competence in integrating web technologies and design tools.\n\nI deeply appreciate Pedro Salazar for his support in the final stage. Together, in just 3 weeks, we fulfilled a childhood dream by creating this video game, while managing other work commitments. Effective task coordination and the ability to work as a team under pressure were crucial in meeting this challenge in such a short time, demonstrating our passion and commitment to the realization of innovative projects.",

Mi contribución incluyó la ejecución de dos proyectos, destacándose entre ellos la creación de una página web.\n\nLa concepción inicial de la página web fue diseñada en Figma por otro miembro del equipo. Mi tarea consistió en llevar a la realidad este diseño, seleccionando el Stack más apropiado para las necesidades de la empresa. Dada la familiaridad predominante en el equipo con el Stack MERN, opté por desarrollar la página web utilizando NextJS, con el objetivo de mejorar su indexación en los principales navegadores.\n\nEs relevante señalar que unos meses después de la finalización del proyecto, REACT anunció su recomendación de elegir uno de los frameworks basados en React populares en la comunidad, entre los cuales se encuentra NextJS. Este hecho valida la elección estratégica realizada durante el desarrollo del proyecto, reafirmando la calidad y pertinencia de la tecnología seleccionada.",

Utilicé HTML5 y JavaScript para desarrollar la lógica del juego y manipular objetos en canvas, complementando con CSS3 para el diseño y maquetación de la interfaz. GitHub sirvió como plataforma de control de versiones, mientras que los gráficos de ambiente y personajes fueron creados con Adobe Illustrator. Este proyecto no solo evidencia mi capacidad para combinar desarrollo front-end con diseño gráfico, sino que también culmina en un juego interactivo que refleja mi competencia en integrar tecnologías web y herramientas de diseño.\n\nAgradezco profundamente a Pedro Salazar por su apoyo en la etapa final. Juntos, y en solo 3 semanas, realizamos un sueño de infancia creando este videojuego, mientras manejábamos otros compromisos laborales. La coordinación efectiva de tareas y la capacidad para trabajar en equipo bajo presión fueron fundamentales para cumplir con este desafío en tan corto tiempo, evidenciando nuestra pasión y compromiso por la realización de proyectos innovadores.",
