Today, access to information is fundamental for making decisions and understanding the world around us. Collecting, filtering, and analyzing data are essential for any investigation.

In this article, I will share techniques learned in Brand, Market, Product, and Self-taught research. Research is divided into three basic pillars:

1.  **Problem Definition**
2.  **Data Collection**
3.  **Data Analysis**

## 1. Problem Definition

This is the foundation of research and usually stems from a hypothesis or a previous objective. It must answer key questions to filter tools and scope:

*   **What do we want to discover or achieve?** Define the main objective.
*   **Why is it important?** Justify the relevance of the study.
*   **What will be the population or object of research?** Delimit the subject of study.
*   **What is the scenario or environment to be measured?** Contextualize the problem.
*   **How are we going to measure it?** Define the metrics or KPIs.
*   **How much time do we have to do it?** Establish a schedule.

## 2. Data Collection

You must determine the types of data needed before choosing the right tool.

### Types of Data

There are two main categories:

#### Qualitative (Descriptive)
Focuses on qualities and non-numerical characteristics.
*   **Nominal:** Grouped by category (Genders, Brands, Colors).
*   **Ordinal:** Grouped by hierarchy (Satisfaction level, Social class).
*   **Binary:** Only two possible answers (Positive/Negative, Yes/No).
*   **Textual:** Subjective information (Comments, Descriptions).

#### Quantitative (Quantities)
Focuses on numbers and statistics.
*   **Discrete:** Whole numbers (Votes, Units sold).
*   **Continuous:** Precise measurements or ranges (Temperature, Weight, Time).

### Ways to Extract Information

#### Primary Collection
Obtaining raw data directly from original sources.
*   **Survey:** Ideal for large-scale simple selection qualitative data.
*   **Interview:** Allows obtaining direct and deep information from experts or users.
*   **Hotjar:** Tool to evaluate user behavior on websites (heatmaps, recordings).
*   **GazeRecorder:** Online *eye tracking* technology for usability studies.

#### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
Use of public information available on the internet.
*   **Perplexity:** AI-powered search engine that builds arguments with cited references.
*   **Youtube Summary:** Extension to summarize YouTube videos using ChatGPT.
*   **Bing:** Search engine with integrated AI to combine information and visual inspiration.

#### Advanced Search Operators
Commands to filter results in search engines like Google:

- **filetype:pdf** + your query - Search for files in specific formats.
- **site:example.com** + your query - Search only within a specific domain.
- **related:example.com** - Find sites with similar content.
- Quotes **"your phrase"** - Search for exact phrases.
- Hyphen **-term** - Exclude terms from the search (e.g., jaguar -car).

## 3. Data Analysis

It is the moment to obtain conclusions based on the initial approach and the collected data. It is divided into four levels:

*   **Descriptive Analysis:** Describes characteristics, patterns, and past trends.
*   **Diagnostic Analysis:** Seeks to understand the underlying causes of events.
*   **Predictive Analysis:** Uses historical data and models to predict future scenarios.
*   **Prescriptive Analysis:** Suggests the best action to take based on predictions.

### Data Visualization

To facilitate decision-making, it is crucial to represent data visually:

*   **Frameworks:** Tools like User Persona, Customer Journey Map, Blue Ocean, or Empathy Map.
*   **Mind Maps:** To organize and connect ideas logically.
*   **Line or Bar Charts:** Ideal for showing growth and temporal relationships.
*   **Radial Charts:** Pie Charts or Spider Charts for comparisons.
*   **Pyramid Diagrams:** To show hierarchies or process funnels.
