Marketing has had different approaches throughout history. In this publication, you'll discover its **complete evolution**, the perspective of marketing expert **Philip Kotler**, and what version 4.0 holds for modern brands.

## The Beginnings of Marketing 1.0 {#marketing-1-0}

Marketing has had to adapt its objectives in line with how customer needs and demands have changed.

Originally, people settled for the first product offered to them that they needed at that moment. Imagine we live in an ancient era, in a small town where there's only one baker. Today you need bread, you go to the store and they offer you one that's hard (possibly old). Don't you want it? Remember you have to go find the next nearest bakery in your town, which is a day's ride away on a path full of possible threats and dangers… **Are you sure you don't want the hard bread?**

Now several years have passed, there's not just one bakery in your town anymore, you can choose between different stores and varieties of products. And not only that! Now you discover these products in things called "the newspaper," "the radio," and "the television."

**From the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, marketing is known as version 1.0**, its focus is based exclusively on the product, due to the low supply that existed in the market and high demand.

### Characteristics of Marketing 1.0

- **Focused on selling products**: The focus was on the transaction, not the relationship
- **Basic customers**: Only sought to meet their fundamental needs
- **Price as main value**: The economic factor was the key differentiator
- **Unilateral communication**: Traditional media without the possibility of customer response

## Origin of Marketing 2.0 {#marketing-2-0}

Over time, something has changed in your mindset. You're no longer a customer who buys a product just for its economic value, now you care more about the **experience and emotions** it makes you feel.

Let's imagine the following: Your young son is having a birthday and you want to make him "happy." Where would you take him? He tells you he loves hamburgers and playgrounds… What do you think about a place called "McDonald's"? I'm sure it sounds great to you.

Now there are many brands that realized your new need called "experience," they think of you beyond just the product and that's why they want to know your opinion to find out what's really important to you.

Over the years, technology has evolved tremendously. Can you believe you now have a mobile phone with internet? Companies would love to interact with you to know your experience with them. How about we leave a message on the web or send an email to McDonald's to tell them how your son's birthday went?

**In the mid to late 20th century, marketing 2.0 emerged.** It focuses on the customer and their emotions, because there was a greater supply in the market, which generated more criteria for consumers' product choices.

### Characteristics of Marketing 2.0

- **Focused on satisfying and retaining**: Not just selling, but creating loyalty
- **Customers with emotions**: People with more complex selection criteria
- **Person as main value**: Beyond price, experience matters
- **Bilateral communication**: Emergence of interactive channels that allow feedback

## The Birth of Marketing 3.0 {#marketing-3-0}

If we understand that the core of marketing 1.0 is the product and marketing 2.0 is the customer and their experience, marketing 3.0 had to go beyond those factors. Marketers asked themselves again: **What else is important to customers?** and **What needs do they have?**

Over a few years, thanks to technological advances and the emergence of new tools (such as social media), marketers were able to know their customers more and more. In this way, they delved into their psychology and discovered the answer:

> **"We are all people"**

If you look at social media, you'll see completely different people dancing, laughing, sharing, and much more... We have different values and principles, we are human with feelings and priorities such as family, friendship, love, justice, and more.

**In the early 21st century and for a decade and a half, marketing 3.0 emerged.** Its main focus is to stop seeing the customer as just a consumer, they began to see them as a person and recognized that both they and the company were part of a society.

### Characteristics of Marketing 3.0

- **Centered on values and purpose**: Making the world a better place
- **Integral human beings**: Not just customers, but people with mind, heart, and spirit
- **Environment/community as value**: Social and environmental impact matters
- **Multidirectional communication**: Conversations on multiple channels and directions

## The New Era, Marketing 4.0 {#marketing-4-0}

Welcome to the present! Thanks to globalization and the large amount of information on the internet, you know that not many have been as lucky as you. Some children don't have shoes to walk in and many people don't have work or food tonight.

What would you think if I told you that for every [3 euros you spend at TOMS, 1 euro will be donated to make sneakers](https://www.toms.com/us/impact.html) for these children, or that [if you eat at Social Bites, you're helping many people who lived on the street by giving them food and work](https://social-bite.co.uk/)? **Would you feel that by buying a product from these companies, you make the world a little better?**

Now brands have realized that we and they are part of a community, that we coexist and that the most important thing is to work together to make the world a better place to live.

**In the mid-second decade of the 21st century, marketing 4.0 emerged.** Its main focus is **social purpose**.

### The Origin According to Philip Kotler {#philip-kotler}

According to marketing expert **Philip Kotler**, creator of the concept:

> "Marketing 4.0 emerges when offline meets online, style meets substance, and machine meets human"

This adapts perfectly to current reality. Let's look at some examples:

**1. Digital-Physical Integration**
The world is connected in thousands of different ways with social media, internet forums, WhatsApp… Just look at how remote work was possible as a consequence of COVID-19.

**2. Substance Over Style**
When we make a purchase, we evaluate many factors beforehand. [Perhaps you don't buy chocolate made with palm oil](https://www.ngenespanol.com/naturaleza/grave-deforestacion-aceite-palma/) or you don't buy from cosmetic product companies that test on animals. Your principles are more important to you than buying something against them that is good, beautiful, cheap, or popular.

**3. Big Data and Personalization**
You've probably felt at some point that internet advertising seems to listen to you, showing you products and offers at the moment you need them most. Google and social media have such good learning algorithms that one could believe they will someday know more about you than yourself. This information is known as **"Big Data."**

### The 4.0 Customers {#customers-4-0}

There's a new characteristic of customers that has changed the market. **Have you noticed everything you do before making an important purchase?**

#### The new customer journey:

1. **Search for the product** and study all its qualities
2. **See online reviews** of the product
3. **Compare** with other similar products
4. **See online reviews** of those products
5. **Ask** friends, family, or acquaintances who may know about the products that convince you most
6. **Buy** the product and try it
7. **Share your opinion** and you may recommend it if you liked it

People have become **shopping experts** and we help each other get better results. There's a large amount of information on the internet that helps both buyers and sellers.

After all, if you're a company that gets bad reviews of a product, you'll know exactly what to do to improve it and make customers like it.

### Characteristics of Marketing 4.0

- **Centered on social purpose**: Brands that collaborate with society for a better world
- **Human brands/companies**: Authenticity and transparency as pillars
- **Emotional satisfaction with Big Data**: Extreme personalization based on data
- **Omnichannel**: 360º strategies with omnidirectional communication

## Conclusion

The evolution of marketing reflects the evolution of society itself. We've gone from a product-centered model to one centered on **positive social impact**. Marketing 4.0 is not just a business strategy, it's a commitment to making the world a better place while building sustainable businesses.
