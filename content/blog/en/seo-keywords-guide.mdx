The first step to achieving a prominent position on Google is defining and correctly using your **keywords**. If you're new to the world of SEO, this comprehensive guide is essential reading that will transform how you approach search engine optimization.

In today's digital landscape, where over 8.5 billion searches happen daily on Google alone, understanding keywords is not just important—it's absolutely critical for online visibility. Whether you're building a business website, launching an e-commerce store, or creating a personal blog, mastering keyword strategy will determine whether your content gets found or remains invisible.

By the end of this ultimate guide, you'll have a complete understanding of keyword types, the best research tools available, and proven strategies to rank your website on the first page of Google.

## What Are Keywords? {#what-are-keywords}

When we talk about **keywords** or **key phrases** in [SEO](/en/blog/marketing-digital/seo-beginners-guide), we're referring to the most important element for making your website appear in Google's top positions.

### The Essential Definition

Keywords are one or more words that describe the content of a web page. At the same time, keywords are the search terms that users type into Google to find information. The fundamental goal of SEO is to align your website's keywords with the terms your target audience is searching for.

**You should always want your search terms to match your website's keywords as closely as possible**, because this alignment directly results in better rankings in Google's search results.

### Keywords vs. Search Terms: Understanding the Difference

While often used interchangeably, there's a subtle but important distinction:

- **Keywords**: The terms you strategically target and optimize your content for
- **Search Terms**: The actual words and phrases users type into search engines

The magic happens when your chosen keywords align perfectly with what your potential customers are searching for. This is why keyword research is so fundamentally important—it bridges the gap between your content and user intent.

### Why Keywords Matter for Your Business

Understanding and implementing keywords correctly impacts:

- **Organic visibility**: Higher rankings mean more free traffic
- **Qualified traffic**: Right keywords attract the right audience
- **Conversion rates**: Intent-matched keywords drive better conversions
- **Content strategy**: Keywords guide what content to create
- **Competitive advantage**: Smart keyword choices help you outrank competitors

## Keywords by Search Intent {#keywords-by-intent}

Keywords can be grouped into two main categories: by their **search intent** and by their **length**. Understanding the nature of the keyword types you're using helps you achieve better results in your marketing objectives.

### Understanding Search Intent

Search intent (also called user intent) is the reason behind a user's search query. Google has become incredibly sophisticated at understanding intent, and matching your content to the right intent is crucial for ranking success.

Let's explore the five main types of keywords based on search intent:

### 1. Informational Keywords

**Purpose**: When the user is seeking information. These are searches with low commercial intent but high traffic potential.

**Characteristics**:
- Often start with "what," "how," "why," or "when"
- Users want to learn, not buy
- Great for building authority and trust
- Perfect for blog content and educational resources

**Examples**:
- "What is SEO?"
- "How to choose an electric scooter?"
- "What are the best cars of 2025?"
- "How does Google ranking work?"
- "Why is keyword research important?"

**Best content types**: Blog posts, guides, tutorials, videos, infographics

### 2. Navigational Keywords

**Purpose**: Searches for a specific website the user already knows. These can be complete URLs or brand names.

**Characteristics**:
- User knows exactly where they want to go
- Brand awareness is already established
- High conversion potential for known brands
- Difficult to rank for competitor brand terms

**Examples**:
- "Alkitu.com"
- "Xiaomi scooters"
- "Mercedes Benz"
- "Nike official website"
- "Amazon customer service"

**Best strategy**: Ensure your brand ranks first for your own brand terms

### 3. Transactional Keywords

**Purpose**: Searches with clear purchase intent. The user is ready to buy.

**Characteristics**:
- Highest commercial value
- Strong conversion rates
- Often include words like "buy," "price," "deal," "discount"
- Competitive and often expensive for paid ads

**Examples**:
- "Alkitu services pricing"
- "Buy Xiaomi scooter"
- "Used Mercedes cars for sale"
- "SEO services cost"
- "Web development agency rates"

**Best content types**: Product pages, service pages, pricing pages, landing pages

### 4. Commercial Investigation Keywords

**Purpose**: Searches with informational intent but close to a purchase decision. Users are comparing options.

**Characteristics**:
- Users are in the consideration phase
- Comparisons and reviews are valued
- Good opportunity to showcase your expertise
- Medium-high conversion potential

**Examples**:
- "Top 5 marketing agencies Valencia"
- "Best scooter 2025"
- "Which Mercedes model should I buy?"
- "SEMrush vs Ahrefs comparison"
- "Best web hosting for small business"

**Best content types**: Comparison articles, reviews, "best of" lists, buyer's guides

### 5. Multimedia Keywords

**Purpose**: Searches intended to find visual content like images, videos, or graphics.

**Characteristics**:
- Users want visual content specifically
- Great for image SEO opportunities
- Can drive significant traffic from image search
- Important for visual industries (design, photography, real estate)

**Examples**:
- "Alkitu logo designs"
- "Scooter photos"
- "Mercedes Class A interior"
- "Web design inspiration"
- "Before and after website redesign"

**Best strategy**: Optimize images with descriptive filenames, alt text, and structured data

### Maximizing Your Intent Strategy

**Our recommendation** is to always use different search intent keywords on your website. You'll need to create content on your blog that satisfies various search terms, but this approach can generate more sales conversions.

**When you establish yourself as an expert in your area**, it becomes much easier to generate the necessary trust in your visitors to convert them into customers. Informational content builds authority, which makes transactional content more effective.

## Keywords by Length {#keywords-by-length}

The second way to categorize keywords is by their length, which directly correlates with search volume, competition, and conversion potential.

### Understanding the Keyword Funnel

Think of keywords as a funnel:
- **Top of funnel**: Short, broad terms (high volume, low conversion)
- **Middle of funnel**: Medium-length terms (moderate volume and conversion)
- **Bottom of funnel**: Long, specific terms (low volume, high conversion)

### 1. Head-Tail Keywords (Short Keywords)

**Characteristics**:
- 1-2 words
- Extremely high search volume
- Very high competition
- Difficult to rank for
- Lower conversion rates due to vague intent

**Examples**:
- "Electric cars"
- "Community Manager"
- "Massages"
- "SEO"
- "Web design"

**Challenge**: These keywords are dominated by major websites and require significant authority to rank. A search for "SEO" could mean the user wants a definition, tools, services, jobs, or tutorials—the intent is unclear.

**Strategy**: Use as topic themes rather than primary targets for new websites.

### 2. Middle-Tail Keywords (Medium Keywords)

**Characteristics**:
- 3-4 words
- Moderate search volume
- Medium competition
- Better conversion potential
- More specific intent

**Examples**:
- "Electric car maintenance"
- "Community Manager pricing"
- "Wooden massage tools"
- "SEO best practices"
- "WordPress web design"

**Best for**: Established websites looking to expand their reach. These keywords balance volume with specificity.

**Strategy**: Target these as primary keywords for important pages and cornerstone content.

### 3. Long-Tail Keywords (Long Keywords)

**Characteristics**:
- 5+ words
- Lower search volume
- Much less competition
- Highest conversion rates
- Very specific intent

**Examples**:
- "Electric car repair shop in Valencia"
- "Community manager and content creator services"
- "Wooden back massage techniques for pain relief"
- "SEO optimization for Next.js applications"
- "Affordable web design for small business startups"

**Why long-tail keywords are powerful**:
- Easier to rank for (less competition)
- Higher conversion rates (specific intent = qualified traffic)
- Perfect for new websites and specific niches
- Often represent users closer to purchase decision
- Can rank quickly compared to shorter terms

**Long-tail keywords are typically the best keywords for positioning in new niches**, and in terms of conversions, they guarantee the best results by responding to such specific needs.

### The Long-Tail Advantage in Numbers

Consider this comparison:

**Head-tail "SEO"**:
- Monthly searches: 1,000,000+
- Competition: Extremely high
- Conversion rate: ~1%
- Realistic ranking time: Years (if ever)

**Long-tail "SEO services for small business Valencia"**:
- Monthly searches: 100-500
- Competition: Low to medium
- Conversion rate: ~10-15%
- Realistic ranking time: 2-6 months

While the head-tail term has massive volume, the long-tail version is far more valuable for actual business results.

### Step 2: Understand Your Audience

Create detailed buyer personas that answer:

- Where are they in the buying journey?

### Step 3: Map Keywords to the Buyer's Journey

### Step 4: Analyze Competition

- What's the domain authority of ranking sites?
- Can you create something significantly better?

### Step 5: Prioritize Keywords

Create a priority matrix based on:

**Priority formula**: (Search Volume × Business Value) / Keyword Difficulty

## Keyword Implementation Guide {#keyword-implementation}

Once you've selected your target keywords, proper implementation is crucial for ranking success.

### Where to Place Your Keywords

#### 1. Page Title (Title Tag)

## Common Keyword Mistakes to Avoid {#common-mistakes}

Even experienced marketers make these keyword mistakes. Learn to recognize and avoid them:

### 1. Keyword Stuffing

**The mistake**: Cramming as many keywords as possible into your content, making it unreadable and spammy.

**Example of stuffing**: "Looking for SEO keywords? Our SEO keywords guide covers all SEO keywords you need. SEO keywords are important for SEO keyword success."

**The fix**: Write naturally for humans first. Aim for 1-2% keyword density and use variations.

### 2. Ignoring Search Intent

**The mistake**: Creating content that doesn't match what users actually want when they search.

**Example**: Writing a blog post for "buy running shoes" (transactional intent) instead of a product page.

**The fix**: Analyze the top 10 results for your keyword. What type of content ranks? Match that format and intent.

### 3. Targeting Only High-Volume Keywords

**The mistake**: Chasing keywords with massive search volume that are impossible to rank for.

**Example**: A new website trying to rank for "SEO" (millions of searches) instead of "SEO services for restaurants Valencia."

**The fix**: Balance your keyword portfolio with long-tail, low-competition keywords for quick wins.

### 4. Forgetting Local Keywords

**The mistake**: Not including geographic modifiers for location-based businesses.

**Example**: A Valencia-based agency targeting "web design" instead of "web design Valencia."

**The fix**: Add city, region, and "near me" variations to capture local search traffic.

### 5. Not Updating Keyword Strategy

**The mistake**: Setting keywords once and never revisiting them.

**Example**: Still targeting keywords from 2019 without checking if search behavior has changed.

**The fix**: Review and update your keyword strategy quarterly. Search trends evolve constantly.

### 6. Cannibalization

**The mistake**: Multiple pages targeting the same keyword, causing them to compete against each other.

**Example**: Three blog posts all trying to rank for "SEO best practices."

**The fix**: Conduct a content audit, consolidate similar content, and ensure each page targets unique keywords.

### 7. Neglecting Secondary Keywords

**The mistake**: Focusing only on the primary keyword and missing opportunities for related terms.

**Example**: A page targeting only "email marketing" without including "email campaigns," "newsletter marketing," etc.

**The fix**: Research and naturally incorporate secondary keywords, LSI terms, and variations.

## Keyword Best Practices {#best-practices}

Follow these proven practices to maximize your keyword strategy effectiveness:

### Research Best Practices

- **Start with seed keywords**: Begin with 5-10 broad terms related to your business
- **Expand systematically**: Use tools to discover variations, questions, and related terms
- **Analyze competitors**: See what keywords drive traffic to similar websites
- **Consider seasonality**: Some keywords peak at certain times of year
- **Check trends**: Ensure keywords aren't declining in popularity

- **Topic clusters**: Group related keywords into comprehensive content hubs
- **Answer questions**: Create content that directly answers search queries
- **Update regularly**: Refresh content to maintain relevance and rankings
- **Add unique value**: Provide information competitors don't offer

### Technical Best Practices

- **Page speed**: Faster pages rank better and convert more
